One day while getting my oil changed at Southeast Mine Supply I received a call about joining a "Ween" cover band. I confess I had never heard about Ween, but the pitch was good. "Highly irreverant and mostly innapropriate" was an immediate sell. 

Flash forward to mid year and we've done our first Gig for a private party at the Red Dog. Exciting things are coming for this band! 

I've learned a ton by working with these musicians. Technical know-how at the musical theory and audio hardware level + talent makes for a high-production show. 

In ear monitoring is a game changer and having your own custom mix makes playing SO MUCH more enjoyable, especially if you need to sit in the back of the mix and groove.
