## Would you like some cake? Yes? You must be "still alive".

I got some inspiration to try and create the effect from *Portal*, a.k.a. GLaDOS. It's a lot of fun—there are things I could have smoothed out—but I'm satisfied with this pass.

The song is *Still Alive* and by the great and creative Jonathan Coulton—check out his website: [jonathancoulton.com](http://jonathancoulton.com)
