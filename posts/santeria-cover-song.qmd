This is a video of me covering *Santeria* by Sublime. I’m not an expert on video production, but I do know it is very important to get your llamas in frame- whether they be of the cup or stuffed variety.

I also used a **UA Apollo Twin** as the interface, and everything was tracked in **Ableton**. The video was synced and edited in **Premiere**.
