## I first heard it on *Bojack Horseman*

If you do ever get to talk to me about television I will probably hit you with the *Bojack* recommendation. I think consensus is it warms up into season two, but I actually don't mind the first season.

I think the very adult subject matter throws a lot of people off since sprinkled in are animal jokesâ€”there is a bit of dissonance between the fun puns and existentialist depression. If you watch the whole thing you might hear this song.
