## A familiar piece that brings back my memories of childhood

A nostalgic piano piece, recorded and filmed on Lingít Aaní (Tlingit land). I acknowledge that I’m on the traditional, unceded territory of the Lingít people, specifically the Áak’w Ḵwáan (Tlingit clan) whose stewardship of this land extends since time immemorial.

Robert Schumann titled this piece Of Strange Lands and Strange People. The name suggests mystery, but to me it’s always felt the opposite: deeply familiar, even nostalgic. The melody seems to carry you back, almost to the womb. Fittingly, it’s part of a collection called Scenes from Childhood. This was the very first piece of music in The Adventures of Milo and Otis, a film I grew up with. It was one of the films we owned that felt like part of our home.

That same sense of memory and change is why I chose to film here at Fish Creek and Outer Point. The Douglas development just beyond this area means it won’t stay the same for long. Public comment has already closed, but for now it’s still this quiet, beautiful place. I’m glad to capture this little moment, a snapshot before the landscape shifts, paired with music that has always felt like home.
