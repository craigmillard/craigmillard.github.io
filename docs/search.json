    "text": "One day while getting my oil changed at Southeast Mine Supply I received a call about joining a “Ween” cover band. I confess I had never heard about Ween, but the pitch was good. “Highly irreverant and mostly innapropriate” was an immediate sell.\nFlash forward to mid year and we’ve done our first Gig for a private party at the Red Dog. Exciting things are coming for this band!\nI’ve learned a ton by working with these musicians. Technical know-how at the musical theory and audio hardware level + talent makes for a high-production show.\nIn ear monitoring is a game changer and having your own custom mix makes playing SO MUCH more enjoyable, especially if you need to sit in the back of the mix and groove."

    "text": "I’ve never really taken guitar lessons and am terrified to see all my bad habits face me. It’s a great instrument, but except for a few songs I’m on piano. (So I say “I don’t play guitar… BUT I have watched a lot of Angus Young videos on YouTube” 😉).\n\n\n\nI’ve liked AC/DC since I was a kid. My friend James Dawson burned me all their albums and I actually bought Stiff Upper Lip. I’ve got the “studio” set up.\nIn this clip, at the beginning there’s a little guitar lick that I play which is 100% recorded using the GoPro’s onboard mic. I think it sounds really full because of the sympathetic vibrations coming up the neck and through the attachment device.\nI switch to a mix between the GoPro’s audio and the “studio mix” right before I start singing — if you listen carefully you can hear it. The “studio mix” is the guitar with effects coming in on a 1/4” via a Scarlett 2i2 USB interface. The vocals come in via that big-ass mic with an XLR connection to the Scarlett 2i2.\nGuitar and singing are hard to record (at the same time) because no matter the setup, if you’re using an acoustic guitar you’re going to get a lot of that into the mic. The vocals don’t sound as warm or full as I’d like because I had to adjust (reduce) the vocal track around the 1k to 3k range. I did that because the guitar “slap” percussion was REALLY loud and made the whole mix basically suck green goat balls.\nAnyway — turned out okay."
